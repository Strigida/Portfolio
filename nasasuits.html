              <p class="text-grey" id="left-justify">
                  A few years ago, Retired NASA Astronaut and Distinguished Educator in Residence at Boise State University (BSU) Steve Swanson dropped into our development lab
                  and asked if we wanted a chance to develop Mixed Reality (MR) HUD interfaces for NASA astronaut helmets. He said the applications we produced would
                  be considered research projects for NASA, and that our ideas and code would be used for Extra-Vehicular Activities (EVAs) on the International Space Station,
                  and eventually on the Orion spacecraft, the Lunar Gateway, and in Mars missions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="text-grey" id="left-justify">
                  Of course I jumped at the chance, and spent the last two years of my undergraduate career working on this amazing project. Steve became one of our team's
                  mentors, along with Dr. Karen Doty, our resident Human Computer Interaction consultant and professor. Because of that simple interaction I've gotten to
                  work with the NASA SUITS Educational team at Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, as well as with both the development and UX design teams to make
                  ARSIS a multi-faceted HUD with the capacity to improve safety, increase crew member autonomy, and increase and expand communication between
                  Mission Control and the crew.

                  ARSIS is built for Microsoft HoloLens, and uses a voice interface (like Siri or Cortana). We call the voice interface we created 'ADELE', the Audio Device for
                  Extraterrestrial Listening Environments, which is an homage to Adele Goldstien, one of the original ENIAC programmers. ADELE allows
                  the user to access information about a procedure or task without having to use their hands, thus freeing them up for work. This is especially important
                  for astronauts on EVA, because the bulky gloves they wear donâ€™t allow for fine motor movements required to manually interact with the AR interface.

                  I was honored to be the UX/UI Team Lead for the 2017/2018 year, and BSU NASA SUITS Team Lead for the 2018/2019 year.

                  As UX/UI Team Lead for the 2017/2018 year, I was in charge of leading my team to brainstorm the starting point of the entire project; something that had
                  not previously been prototyped for such an application, or for such technology. Throughout the process, I interfaced with our mentor, Steve, the NASA SUITS
                  Educational Team at JSC, and the UX/UI and development teams. We collaborated to solve unique and complex problems, and thought through designing and
                  implementing something so new it hadn't ever been done before.

              <p class="text-grey" id="left-justify">
                  After a lot of consideration and research I put together sketches,
                  wireframes, flowcharts, and a GUI. We decided to use a 3D modeled interface, and based it off of the look and feel of
                  mathematics calculators and large-buttoned tablets, to give users a refference of what how to interact with the interface. I worked on
                  pencil and paper, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe XD. Once that was finished, I used Blender and Adobe Photoshop to create the models, UV unwrap them,
                  and create textures for each component.

                  As the Team Lead for the 2018/2019 BSU NASAU SUITS Team, I was in charge of organizing the team around a new challenge: creating a navigational assistant on
                  top of the groundbreaking work from the previous year. This new version was named ARSIS 2.0. Our team thrived in working together, and I was able to do some team-coding in Unity using C#, as
                  well as collaborating with the UX/UI team to update the look of our interface entirely. For the 2018/2019 year we decided to go with a 2.5D interface (2D
                  assets in a 3D environment), which allowed for more efficient memory use. I assisted in creating style guides for ARSIS, which we based off of a combination
                  of NASA's own style guides and our own research into the emerging field of AR and MR interfaces.

              <p class="text-grey" id="left-justify">
                  I worked with both teams, and both of our mentors, to incorporate the UX and code together (we had a few Github scares, but we figured it out!), and
                  then we conducted user testing. Our testing focused on moderated usability testing, surveys, and A/B testing. This information was compiled and analyzed so
                  it can be incorporated into future iterations of ARSIS. Beta testing was conducted at Boise State University's anual Bronco Days recruiting event. Volunteer
                  participants within our target demographics played through a testing simulation we created to test all aspects of the software.

              <p class="text-grey" id="left-justify">
                  After that, a specially chosen group from the BSU NASA SUITS Team spent a week at Johnson Space Center in Houston doing further testing, development,
                  and demonstrations under the direction of the NASA SUITS Educational leadership. This testing was conducted primarily at the Human-In-The-Loop testing
                  facility at the HIVE, on NASA JSC campus. The experience was absolutely invaluable, as I got to interact with and see the work of NASA engineers,
                  meet astronauts and cosmonauts, and learn from the amazing people who work at NASA JSC.
